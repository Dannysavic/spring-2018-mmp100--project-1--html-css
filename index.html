<p>Kobe Bryant is a retired professional NBA player. He played for 20 years with the Los Angeles Lakers. Most people think of Kobe and they think of an all-time great (which he is) but not many people know that he actually struggled mightily his first couple seasons. It wasn't until his third or fourth year he actually became the force we all know and recognize today as possibly the best player to ever touch a basketball. Kobe grew up in Italy but his hometown is Philidelphia. Kobe had a very decorated nba career with many awards to show for it. Some of them being 5 nba championships, 15 All NBA selections, 2 time scoring champion, MVP and also being a 18 time all star participant. In my opinion I think kobe is for sure the best player ever. In terms of dominance, overall poise and most of all professionalism. </p>
